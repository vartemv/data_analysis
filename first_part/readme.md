## Overview
This script processes data and generates visualizations using Python. It includes four main functions:

## Features

### 1. Euclidean Distance Calculation
- Computes Euclidean distance between points in two arrays.
- Uses NumPy for efficient computation.

### 2. Graph Generation
- Generates a graph for the function `f_a(x) = a^2 * sin(x)`.
- Uses NumPy broadcasting.
- Allows displaying or saving the graph.

### 3. Sinusoidal Signal Visualization
- Plots three subgraphs for `f1`, `f2`, and their sum.
- Highlights different regions based on predefined conditions.

### 4. Downloading Meteorological Station Data
- Fetches data from [VUT Meteorological Station Data](https://ehw.fit.vutbr.cz/izv/stanice.html).
- Parses and structures the data into a dictionary.

## Usage
